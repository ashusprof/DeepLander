# DeepLander: Thruster Intelligence for Safe Lunar Descent

A Deep Reinforcement Learning project that leverages Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to train an intelligent agent capable of controlling lunar thrusters for a safe and efficient moon landing.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The DeepLander project simulates a lunar lander environment where an agent learns optimal landing strategies through trial and error using Deep Q-Learning. The environment is based on OpenAI Gym's `LunarLander-v3`.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**
- **Experience Replay**
- **Target Networks**
- **Reward Shaping**
- **Environment: LunarLander-v2 (OpenAI Gym)**

## 📁 Files
- `Lunar_Landing.ipynb`: Main notebook with training, evaluation, and results.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Results
The agent successfully learns to land the lunar module with increasing precision after sufficient training episodes. Performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.

## ✅ Getting Started
To run the notebook:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deeplander.git
    cd deeplander
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Launch the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
