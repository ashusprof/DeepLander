# DeepLander: Thruster Intelligence for Safe Lunar Descent ðŸš€

A Deep Reinforcement Learning project that uses Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to train an AI agent to control thrusters for a safe lunar landing using the `LunarLander-v3` environment from `gymnasium`.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
**DeepLander** simulates a lunar lander controlled by an agent trained using Deep Q-Networks. The environment provides continuous feedback as the agent learns to land safely using optimal thruster control strategies.

## ðŸŒŒ Key Concepts
- Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- Experience Replay
- Target Network
- Reward Shaping
- Exploration vs Exploitation
- Environment: `LunarLander-v3` from `gymnasium[box2d]`
